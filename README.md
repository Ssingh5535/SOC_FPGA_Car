# SOC_FPGA_Car
self-driving RC car SoC leverages the PYNQ Z2’s integration of a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 running a Linux-based vision and control stack with tightly coupled PL fabric to implement real-time image preprocessing, AXI-driven PWM servo control, and deterministic I²C and Pmod sensor interfaces. By streaming line-sensor data via UART and AXI4.
